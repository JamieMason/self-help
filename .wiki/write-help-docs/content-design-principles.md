# Apply design principles

**Apply research-backed guidelines to make wikis effective.** These principles come from information
architecture, content design, and cognitive psychology research.

## Labels are the interface

Users construct meaning from labels alone. Every label must pass: "If I click this, I'll find
\_\_\_?"

- Front-load key words (users scan first 2–3 words)
- Use user language, not jargon
- Be specific (vague labels emit no "information scent")
- Keep labels scannable (3–6 words)

**Test:** Show labels without context. Can users predict the content?

## Structure shapes understanding

- Maximum 3–4 levels deep (users lose orientation beyond this)
- 3–7 children per branch (fewer = unnecessary nesting, more = overwhelming)
- Parallel structure at each level (all verbs, all nouns, or all questions)
- Order by likelihood (most common need first)

**Test:** Can users find answers in ≤3 selections?

## Users scan, don't read

- Inverted pyramid: most important information first
- Start with the answer, not background
- Scannable structure: headings, bullets, whitespace
- No happy talk ("Welcome to..." or "In this section...")

**Test:** Is the answer visible without scrolling?

## The tree is a conversation

Each branch is a question, each selection an answer. Design for natural dialogue rhythm.

- Three mindless clicks beat one thoughtful click
- Make backtracking effortless
- No dead ends

**Test:** Does navigation feel like a conversation?

## Testing

- **Tree test:** Show labels without design, ask users to find things
- **Label test:** Show labels out of context, verify predictable
- **Time test:** Users should find answers in ≤3 selections
