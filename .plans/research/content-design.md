# Content Design — Key Learnings

## Summary

Content design is the practice of presenting information based on user needs, not organisational
structure. Good content design allows people to find what they need quickly, understand it
immediately, and act on it. The approach rejects publishing "everything we can" in favour of
publishing "only what someone needs to know so they can complete their task."

## Principles for Self-Help

### 1. Start with User Needs

User needs follow a template: "As a [user], I need to [action], so that [outcome]."

**Application to decision trees:**

- Each branch should represent a genuine user need, not an organisational category
- Branch labels should be actions: "Apply for...", "Check if...", "Find out how..."
- Avoid needs that justify existing content—find the real need first

**Good need:** "As a carer, I need to get financial help, so that I can carry on looking after the
person I care for."

**Bad need:** "As a carer, I need to use a benefits calculator, so that I can find out if I can get
Carer's Allowance." (Suggests a specific solution)

### 2. Content Must Be Task-Based

User needs and content must be based on actions or tasks.

**Active verbs to use:**

- Applying
- Appealing
- Paying for
- Submitting
- Claiming
- Requesting
- Challenging

**Verbs to avoid:**

- Understand (unless required for compliance)
- Know
- Be aware of
- Using (as in a tool)

**Application to decision trees:**

- Branch labels should start with verbs where possible
- Leaf content should answer "what do I do?" not "what should I know?"
- If a leaf only provides information without enabling action, question whether it's needed

### 3. Users Don't Read—They Scan

Research shows people read only 20-28% of a web page. They read in an F-pattern: across the top,
then down the side.

**Application to decision trees:**

- Front-load branch labels with key words
- Put the most important information at the start of leaf content
- Use short sentences (aim for 25 words max)
- Break content with descriptive subheadings

**Good:** "Canteen menu" **Bad:** "What's on the menu at the canteen today?"

### 4. Write for a 9-Year-Old Reading Age

By age 9, children read by recognising word shapes rather than sounding out letters. Adults retain
this skill. Common words (the 5,000 words used by age 5-6) are fastest to process.

**Application to decision trees:**

- Use common words in branch labels
- Avoid technical terms without explanation
- Keep branch labels short—long words cause readers to skip following words

### 5. Avoid Duplication

Duplicate content produces poor search results, confuses users, and damages credibility. Users end
up using offline channels because they're not sure they have all the information.

**Application to decision trees:**

- Each leaf should cover one topic once
- Use hyperlinks to connect related content rather than repeating
- If two paths lead to similar content, consolidate or differentiate clearly

### 6. Plain English Is Mandatory

Higher literacy people prefer plain English because it allows faster comprehension. Research found
80% prefer clear English, rising to 97% for complex issues.

**Application to decision trees:**

- Use "buy" not "purchase", "help" not "assist", "about" not "approximately"
- Explain technical terms on first use
- Use contractions (you'll, we're) but avoid negative contractions (can't, won't)

### 7. Titles Must Be Unique and Informative

Duplicate titles confuse users. Titles should make sense by themselves, in search results, and in
collections.

**Application to decision trees:**

- Every branch label should be unique within its level
- Labels should make sense without seeing the parent branch
- Keep labels under 65 characters where possible

## Patterns to Adopt

### User Need Template

Use for validating each branch/leaf:

```
As a [specific user]
I need to [action verb]
So that [outcome]
```

### Acceptance Criteria

For each user need, define what must be true for the need to be met:

- User understands X
- User can do Y
- User knows what happens next

### Inverted Pyramid

Structure leaf content with most important information first, tapering to lesser detail.

### Front-Loaded Labels

Put searchable/scannable keywords at the start of branch labels and headings.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Publishing Everything

❌ Publishing all available information ✅ Publishing only what's needed to complete the task

### FAQs

❌ FAQ sections (they duplicate content, can't be front-loaded, dump information) ✅ Put answers in
context where users expect them

### Passive Voice

❌ "The form should be submitted" ✅ "Submit the form"

### Organisational Structure

❌ Organising by department or internal process ✅ Organising by user task or journey

### Understanding Without Action

❌ "Understand our policy on X" ✅ "Check if X applies to you" or "Apply for X"

### Questions as Headings

❌ "What do I need to bring?" ✅ "Documents you need"

## Key Quotes

> "Do not publish everything you can online. Publish only what someone needs to know so they can
> complete their task. Nothing more."

> "People do not usually read text unless they want information. When you write for the web, start
> with the same question every time: what does the user want to know?"

> "A website only works if people can find what they need quickly, complete their task and leave
> without having to think about it too much."

> "Research shows that higher literacy people prefer plain English because it allows them to
> understand the information as quickly as possible."

> "FAQs are strongly discouraged. If you write content by starting with user needs, you will not
> need to use FAQs."

## Action Items

- [ ] Audit existing wiki branches against user need template
- [ ] Review branch labels for action verbs vs passive "understand/know" framing
- [ ] Check leaf content follows inverted pyramid (key info first)
- [ ] Ensure all labels are front-loaded with key terms
- [ ] Remove or consolidate any duplicate content
- [ ] Validate label uniqueness at each tree level
- [ ] Test labels/content against plain English guidelines
