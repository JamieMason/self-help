# How to Make Sense of Any Mess — Key Learnings

## Summary

Information architecture is the practice of arranging the parts of something to make it
understandable. Abby Covert's core thesis: information isn't a thing—it's whatever users interpret
from the arrangement of things they encounter. The book provides a seven-step framework for tackling
any "mess" of information: Identify the Mess, State your Intent, Face Reality, Choose a Direction,
Measure the Distance, Play with Structure, and Prepare to Adjust.

## Principles for Self-Help

### 1. Information is Interpretation

**What it means:** Information isn't objective data—it's what users _interpret_ from how things are
arranged. "While we can arrange things with the intent to communicate certain information, we can't
actually _make_ information. Our users do that for us."

**How it applies:**

- Branch labels don't contain meaning; users construct meaning from them
- The order of options matters—it shapes interpretation
- Users bring context, expectations, and mental models to every choice

**Specific changes:**

- Test branch labels with real users to verify interpretation matches intent
- Consider how the sequence of branches shapes understanding
- Document the _intended_ interpretation for each branch

### 2. Start with User Needs, Not Organisational Structure

**What it means:** Content should be organised around what users need to do, not how the
organisation thinks about itself. "Government has a tendency to publish content that is more focused
on what it wants to say than what the user needs to know."

**How it applies:**

- Wiki structure should follow user tasks, not author knowledge organisation
- Branch labels should use user vocabulary, not domain jargon
- Decision trees should start where users start, not where experts think they should

**Specific changes:**

- Begin tree design by listing user tasks/questions
- Use user research to determine entry points
- Validate vocabulary choices against user language

### 3. Define What "Good" Means

**What it means:** Without defining what good means for stakeholders and users, "bad can come out of
nowhere." Every decision should support what you've defined as good.

**How it applies:**

- Each wiki needs explicit quality criteria
- Branch labels need standards (length, tone, vocabulary)
- Leaf content needs templates and guidelines

**Specific changes:**

- Create a "what good looks like" document for each wiki
- Define acceptance criteria for branches and leaves
- State intent explicitly: "Users should describe this wiki as [adjectives]"

### 4. Users Are Complex

**What it means:** "We don't know why we do what we do. We don't really know why we like what we
like, but we do know it when we see it. We're fickle." Users expect things to feel "auto-magic"
while retaining a "human touch."

**How it applies:**

- Users will use wikis in unexpected ways
- They'll scan, skip, and backtrack
- Context varies: device, mood, time pressure, expertise level

**Specific changes:**

- Support non-linear navigation (back, restart, jump)
- Keep branch options scannable (short labels)
- Design for the stressed, distracted user

### 5. Controlled Vocabulary

**What it means:** A controlled vocabulary is "an organized list of terms, phrases, and concepts
intended to help someone navigate a specific context." It reduces "linguistic insecurity."

**How it applies:**

- Consistent terminology across branches builds trust
- Synonyms confuse; pick one term and stick with it
- Define what you _don't_ say as well as what you do

**Specific changes:**

- Create a glossary for each wiki
- Document variant spellings, synonyms, and preferred terms
- List terms to avoid (jargon, insider language, ambiguous words)

### 6. Taxonomy: How We Arrange Things

**What it means:** Taxonomy is the method for organising and classifying content. Key patterns:

- **Hierarchical:** Successive categories/ranks (our decision tree structure)
- **Heterarchical:** Items on one level without categorisation
- **Sequential:** Ordered steps
- **Hypertextual:** Links that bridge between structures

**How it applies:**

- Self-help wikis are primarily hierarchical with sequential aspects
- Hypertext (links) can connect related branches without duplication
- Mix approaches: hierarchy for navigation, hypertext for cross-references

**Specific changes:**

- Use hierarchy for main navigation (branch structure)
- Consider hypertext for "see also" connections between leaves
- Evaluate whether some sequences should be explicit flows

### 7. Broad-Shallow vs Narrow-Deep

**What it means:** "A broad and shallow hierarchy gives the user more choices up front so they can
get to everything in a few steps." "A narrow and deep hierarchy gives the user fewer choices at
once."

**How it applies:**

- Too many options at once overwhelms
- Too few options per level means too many clicks
- Balance depends on user expertise and task complexity

**Specific changes:**

- Aim for 3-7 options per branch (cognitive load research)
- Go deeper for complex topics, shallower for simple ones
- Test with users: "Did you expect more/fewer options here?"

### 8. Language is the Material of Intent

**What it means:** "The words we choose change the things we make and how we think about them."
Language choices constrain and enable design decisions.

**How it applies:**

- Branch labels ARE the interface
- Word choice shapes user expectations
- Tone affects trust and engagement

**Specific changes:**

- Treat label writing as design work, not afterthought
- Use action-oriented language where appropriate
- Match user vocabulary discovered through research

### 9. Watch Out for Options and Opinions

**What it means:** Requirements should describe results without implying solutions. "A weak
requirement might be written as: 'A user is able to easily publish an article with one click of a
button.' This simple sentence implies the interaction, the interface, and introduces an ambiguous
measurement of quality."

**How it applies:**

- Wiki design should focus on user outcomes
- Don't let implementation options masquerade as requirements
- "Easily" is not measurable; define success criteria

**Specific changes:**

- Frame requirements as: "User can [outcome]" not "System has [feature]"
- Remove ambiguous qualifiers
- Define measurable success criteria

### 10. Ambiguity vs Exactitude Trade-off

**What it means:** "The more ambiguous you are, the more likely it is that people will have trouble
using your taxonomy. The more exact your taxonomy becomes, the less flexible it is."

**How it applies:**

- Overly specific branch labels may not match user mental models
- Overly vague labels require users to guess
- Classification decisions reflect worldview, culture, privilege

**Specific changes:**

- Test label specificity with users
- When in doubt, prefer clarity over flexibility
- Be aware of cultural assumptions in classification

## Patterns to Adopt

- **State intent explicitly:** Write down what adjectives users should use to describe the wiki
- **Controlled vocabulary:** Document preferred terms AND terms to avoid
- **User as interpreter:** Test that users interpret content as intended
- **Why-What-How framework:** Start with why, then what, then how
- **Multiple structures:** Try arranging content 2-3 different ways before committing
- **Be the filter:** Remove what doesn't serve the user; don't just add

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Organisation-centred structure:** Building trees around how experts think, not user needs
- **Assuming users are like you:** "If you believe your users are like you but they're not, there's
  more room for incorrect assumptions"
- **Facade without foundation:** Styling decisions without structural decisions
- **Linguistic insecurity:** Inconsistent terminology that erodes trust
- **Solving alone:** "Making maps and diagrams alone at your desk is not practicing information
  architecture"
- **One structure fits all:** Not testing alternative arrangements

## The Seven-Step Framework Applied to Self-Help

1. **Identify the Mess:** What information problems does this wiki solve? Who are the users?
2. **State your Intent:** What should users say about this wiki? What words do we use/avoid?
3. **Face Reality:** What contexts/channels do users encounter this in? Who are all the players?
4. **Choose a Direction:** What vocabulary? What structure type? What level of detail?
5. **Measure the Distance:** How do we know if users succeed? What are our baselines?
6. **Play with Structure:** Try multiple arrangements. Test hierarchy depth/breadth.
7. **Prepare to Adjust:** Plan for iteration. Get early feedback. Don't hide from users.
