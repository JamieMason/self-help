# Everyday Information Architecture — Key Learnings

Source: A Book Apart product page, author bio, endorsements Author: Lisa Maria Marquis

## Summary

Everyday Information Architecture is a practical, accessible guide to structuring web content. The
book focuses on making content findable, understandable, and usable by being intentional about
organisation. It covers content analysis, categories, labels, site structure, navigation, and
taxonomies—all with the goal of creating better experiences through thoughtful structure.

## Principles for Self-Help

### 1. Every Structure Decision Has Consequences

How we organise information changes how people find, understand, and use it. Even small decisions
about categories and labels ripple through the entire user experience.

**Application to decision trees:**

- Each branch point shapes the user's journey
- A poorly placed answer may never be found
- Label choices determine whether users click or bounce
- Structure isn't decoration—it's the experience itself

### 2. Systems of Organisation Must Be Consistent

Random organisation is no organisation. Users need predictable patterns to navigate effectively.

**Principles:**

- Choose an organising principle and stick to it
- Don't mix incompatible schemes at the same level
- Consistency builds user confidence
- Exceptions confuse and slow users down

**Application to decision trees:**

- If branches are questions, all should be questions
- If branches are topics, all should be topics
- Mixing "How do I...?" with "Account settings" breaks the mental model
- Users learn patterns—reward that learning with consistency

### 3. Content Analysis Before Structure

You can't organise what you don't understand. Before building structure, audit your content.

**Questions to ask:**

- What content exists?
- What content is missing?
- What's redundant or outdated?
- Who owns each piece?
- How does it relate to other content?

**Application to decision trees:**

- List all possible answers before designing the tree
- Identify gaps: what questions can't be answered?
- Find duplicates: multiple answers to the same question
- Map relationships: which answers relate to each other?

### 4. Categories Should Be Mutually Exclusive (Where Possible)

When categories overlap, users waste time checking multiple places or miss content entirely.

**Application to decision trees:**

- Each branch should represent a distinct path
- Avoid branches where users think "it could be either"
- If overlap is unavoidable, use clear differentiating criteria
- Test: can users confidently choose one option?

### 5. Labels Are Promises

A label tells users what they'll find. Breaking that promise destroys trust.

**Good labels:**

- Accurately describe what's inside
- Use words users know
- Differentiate clearly from siblings
- Stand alone without context

**Application to decision trees:**

- Test labels: "If I click this, I'll find X"
- Avoid internal jargon
- Front-load with distinctive words
- Match the label's promise in the content

### 6. Navigation Is Wayfinding

Navigation helps users answer: Where am I? Where can I go? How do I get back?

**Application to decision trees:**

- Always show current position (breadcrumbs)
- Make the path back obvious
- Show progress through the journey
- Don't trap users in dead ends

### 7. Taxonomies Enable Connections

Tags and taxonomies link related content that might live in different structural locations.

**Application to decision trees:**

- Consider tagging answers with topics
- Enable "related answers" through shared tags
- Taxonomies supplement tree structure—they don't replace it
- Keep controlled vocabulary simple and user-focused

- Auditing existing content
- Identifying gaps and redundancies
- Understanding content relationships
- Documenting content attributes

### Categories and Labels

- Creating meaningful groups
- Naming groups clearly
- Testing label effectiveness
- Avoiding overlap and ambiguity

### Site Structure

- Hierarchies and their limitations
- Flat vs deep structures
- Balancing breadth and depth
- Planning for growth

### Navigation and Wayfinding

- Navigation UI patterns
- Orientation cues
- Progressive disclosure
- Contextual navigation

### Tags and Taxonomies

- When to use metadata
- Building controlled vocabularies
- Connecting content across structures
- Maintaining taxonomies over time

---

## Patterns to Adopt

### Content Audit First

Before designing structure:

1. Inventory all existing content
2. Identify what's missing
3. Remove duplicates/outdated items
4. Map relationships between items

### Clear Differentiation

At each branch:

- Each option should be obviously different
- Users shouldn't wonder "which one?"
- Add qualifying words if needed to distinguish

### Progressive Refinement

- Start broad, get specific
- Each level narrows the options meaningfully
- Don't jump from vague to hyper-specific

### Test Labels with Users

- Show labels out of context
- Ask "What would you find here?"
- If users guess wrong, the label is wrong

### Controlled Vocabulary

For tagging/taxonomy:

- Define terms clearly
- Use terms consistently
- Prefer user language over internal jargon
- Keep the vocabulary small and focused

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Organising Without Understanding

❌ Building structure before knowing content ✅ Content audit first, structure second

### Inconsistent Organisation Schemes

❌ Mixing questions with topics with audience segments ✅ Pick one scheme per level and stick to it

### Ambiguous Categories

❌ Overlapping options that could contain the same content ✅ Mutually exclusive categories with
clear boundaries

### Jargon Labels

❌ Internal terminology users don't know ✅ Plain language from user research

### Missing Wayfinding

❌ No indication of location or path ✅ Breadcrumbs, progress indicators, clear back options

### Over-Complex Taxonomies

❌ Hundreds of tags with subtle distinctions ✅ Small, focused vocabulary that covers real needs

## Application to Self-Help Decision Trees

### Pre-Design Checklist

Before building a tree:

- [ ] List all answers/outcomes the tree should provide
- [ ] Identify gaps: what questions remain unanswered?
- [ ] Group related answers: what connects them?
- [ ] Define the primary organising principle

### Structure Guidelines

1. **Organising principle:** Task-based ("I need to...") works best for help content
2. **Consistency:** Same type of choice at each level
3. **Mutual exclusivity:** Clear criteria for each branch
4. **Reasonable depth:** 3-4 levels maximum where possible

### Label Guidelines

1. **User language:** Words they'd search for
2. **Self-sufficient:** Makes sense without parent
3. **Differentiated:** Obviously different from siblings
4. **Front-loaded:** Key words first

### Navigation Guidelines

1. **Breadcrumbs:** Show path taken
2. **Progress:** Show depth/remaining
3. **Back option:** Easy to revise choices
4. **Start over:** Quick reset

### Taxonomy Guidelines (if using tags)

1. **Small vocabulary:** 10-20 core tags maximum
2. **User-focused:** Terms users recognise
3. **Defined:** Clear scope for each tag
4. **Maintained:** Regular review and cleanup

## Relationship to Other Research

### Complements Content Design (Sarah Winters)

- Content Design: What to write, how to write it
- Everyday IA: Where to put it, how to organise it
- Both: User-centred, task-focused

### Complements Information Architecture (Rosenfeld/Morville)

- Polar bear book: Comprehensive theory and frameworks
- Everyday IA: Practical, accessible implementation
- Both: Same principles, different depth

### Complements Don't Make Me Think (Krug)

- Krug: Users don't read, they scan
- Everyday IA: Structure and labels enable scanning
- Both: Minimise cognitive load

## Action Items

- [ ] Conduct content audit of existing wiki answers
- [ ] Define organising principle for tree structure
- [ ] Check branch labels for consistency and clarity
- [ ] Test labels with users out of context
- [ ] Review for ambiguous/overlapping categories
- [ ] Ensure wayfinding elements present (breadcrumbs, back, start over)
- [ ] Consider simple taxonomy for cross-linking related answers
- [ ] Document structure decisions for future maintainers
