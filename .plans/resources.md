# Research Plan: Information Design & User-Centred Content

Phased research to inform the design of self-help wikis and content structure.

## Goal

Read and extract actionable insights from key resources on information architecture, content design,
and interactive workflows. Document learnings relevant to self-help's decision tree format.

## Research Approach

For each resource:

1. **Find the author's blog/site** — Authors often share key ideas freely; look for articles, talks,
   interviews
2. **Search for the book online** — Check if a free/legal version exists (author's site, Internet
   Archive, publisher preview)
3. **Find summaries or reviews** — Blog posts, book summaries, conference talks
4. **Search for related articles** — The same topics covered by other authors, especially online
   resources
5. **Extract relevant insights** — Focus on what applies to decision trees and interactive content

Prioritise depth over breadth. A few well-understood principles are more valuable than surface-level
coverage of many books.

## Output

For each resource, create a document in `.plans/research/` containing:

- Key principles relevant to self-help
- Specific applications to our wiki structure
- Patterns or anti-patterns to adopt/avoid
- Quotes or frameworks worth referencing

**Status:** [x] Complete

All research synthesised into actionable authoring guidelines:

- **Output:** `.plans/research/authoring-guidelines.md`
- **Contents:**
  - Design philosophy (user-centred principles)
  - Branch label guidelines (front-loading, user language, specificity)
  - Structure guidelines (depth, breadth, organisation schemes)
  - Navigation requirements (wayfinding, recovery)
  - Leaf content principles (inverted pyramid, plain English)

## Next Steps

Consider:
